    <h1>My Favourite hobby is Soccer</h1>
    <p>I love Soccer because Soccer is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word soccer normally means the form of soccer that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football.[1][2] These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes making it my first favorite sport.</p>
